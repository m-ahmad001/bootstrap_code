    <h1>What Is C++ Programming Language</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>C++</strong> programming language. We will see what exactly is
      <strong>C++</strong> and when it was created why it was created? You know
      a bit of information about the history of <strong>C++</strong>. so first
      of all, what exactly is
      <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>C</strong></span> ?
    </p>
    <p>
      Now all of you know that a computer is an electronic device that can
      perform any computational task. But since it is a machine, these computers
      really can’t do anything on their own. To get any job done using the
      computer, we need to give instructions to this computer, and according to
      our instructions, this computer will work. These instructions which are
      assigned to this computer are called the “<strong>Program</strong>, “and
      the person who is going to write these instructions or who is going to
      give this instruction is called a “<strong>Programmer</strong>”
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Now the language in which these instructions are written, or these
      programs are written, is called the “Programming Language”. Here, the
      programmer will use any of the programming languages available and write
      the computer program or the instructions, and according to this program,
      the computer will work. Here, C++ is one of the programming languages that
      C++ can use to write computer programs. There are a lot of programming
      languages available.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      During the 1970s C programming language was one of the most used the most
      popular programming language. Even to this day, the C programming language
      is one of the most famous programming languages. But C programming
      language has its limitations.<br />Year by year, the computational
      capacity of the computers increased, and also the programming complexity
      increased. The C programming language problem was as the programming
      complexity increased and the programs tend to become larger, it was
      challenging to manage and write the code using the C language for those
      complex computational tasks. So Bjarne Strostroup and his team started
      working on the C programming language. They added a lot of features; the
      central part they said was the object-oriented programming features.
